******************
What is Lightning?
******************
Lightning is an open-source framework to develop Intelligent, distributed cloud applications. We call these applications **Lightning Apps**.

************************
What is a Lightning App?
************************
A Lightning app is a simple way to define a distributed, complex cloud app for machine learning.
These applications require coordination of complex cloud resources such as high-speed disks for data loading,
model training, deployment servers, load-balancers, and more. The interaction between these components
happens in simple python instead of dozens of complex YAML files.
