Build a Lightning component
###########################
**Prereqs:** You know *basic* Python.

**Goal:** In this guide you'll learn to develop `a Lightning component <https://lightning.ai/components>`_.

*****************************
What is a Lightning component
*****************************
Full stack AI apps require many pieces working tightly together, such as training, deploying, data annotation. However, this tight coupling
can lead to monoliths that are hard to scale. Breaking up a monolithic application leads to a ton of microservices which can't be managed
correctly, monitored or scaled. A component is a self-contained piece of code (ie: a microservice) that manages its own infrastructure,
auto-scaling, costs, and more.

[] -> [] -> [] images

Components can be connected together to form a Lightning App (ie: a bundled set of microservices). The resulting Lightning App offers
many key advantage:

.. collapse:: Packaged code

   |

   Lightning apps bundles components into an app that runs in any environment. The same code will run on your laptop, 
   or any cloud or private clusters. You don't have to think about the cluster or know anything about the cloud.

.. collapse:: Modularity

   |

   Components are modular and inter-operable by design. Leverage our vibrant community of components so you don't
   have to build each piece of the system yourself.

.. collapse:: Rapid iteration

   |

   Iterate through ideas in hours not months because you don't have to learn a million other concepts that the components 
   handle for you such as kubernetes, cost management, auto-scaling and more.

.. collapse:: Cost control

   |

   The component run-time has been optimized for cost management to support the largest machine-learning workloads.
   Lower your cloud bill with machines that shut down or spin up faster. 

.. collapse:: Build systems not scripts

   |

   The Lightning structure forces best practices so you don't have to be an expert production engineer.
   Although it feels like you're writing a script, you are actually building a production-ready system.

*****************
Install Lightning
*****************
First, install Lightning.

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install -U lightning

.. collapse:: Mac M1/M2/M3 and Windows users

   |

   **Mac**

   To install on Mac, set these 2 environment variables   
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      # needed for M1/M2/M3
      export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL=1
      export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1

      python -m pip install -U lightning

   **Windows users**

   To install on Windows:

   - setup an alias for Python: python=python3
   - Add the root folder of Lightning to the Environment Variables to PATH

**************************
Build your first component
**************************
A Lightning component organizes Python code so it can run on the cloud and be connected with other components to form a Lightning App.
Pick one of these components to run:

.. lit_tabs::
   :titles: Hello world; Train PyTorch on cloud GPUs; Train PyTorch âš¡ on cloud GPUs; Deploy a model on cloud GPUs; Run a model script; Build a model web UI
   :code_files: ./hello_components/hello_world.py; ./hello_components/train_pytorch.py; ./hello_components/train_ptl.py; ./hello_components/deploy_model.py; ./hello_components/run_script.py; ./hello_components/build_demo.py
   :highlights: 1;2;3;4;5;6
   :app_id: abc123
   :tab_rows: 3
   :height: 385px

|

Components run the same on the cloud and locally on your choice of hardware.

.. lit_tabs::
   :titles: Lightning Cloud (fully-managed); Your AWS account; Your own hardware
   :code_files: ./hello_components/code_run_cloud.bash; ./hello_components/code_run_cloud_yours.bash; ./hello_components/code_run_local.bash
   :tab_rows: 3

Key features
************
You now know enough to build a self-contained component that runs any Python code on the cloud that can be connected to form a 
powerful Lightning app. Here are a few key features available to super-charge your work:

.. lit_tabs::
   :titles: 15+ accelerators; Auto-stop idle machines; Auto-timeout submitted work; Use spot machines (~70% discount); Work with massive datasets; Mount cloud storage; Use a custom container
   :code_files: ./key_features/accelerators.py; ./key_features/idle_machine.py; ./key_features/auto_timeout.py; ./key_features/spot.py; ./key_features/massive_dataset.py; ./key_features/mount_data.py; ./key_features/custom_container.py;

***************************
Use the community ecosystem
***************************
Lightning has a vibrant collection of community-built components you can use as templates or to inspire you.

Next: Connect multiple components
*********************************
Now you can build components. To build powerful full stack AI apps you'll need to learn to connect them together.
