*****************
Lightning credits
*****************

Lightning Credits are used to pay for the metered consumption of resources (compute and stoarge). Every Lightning credit = 10$ USD.
You pay for Lightning credits, regardless of the application or use case. Credits will be deducted from your account based on usage of cloud resources: compute (billed every minute) and storage (billed every hour). The up-to-date prices can be found `here <https://lightning.ai/pages/pricing>`_.

This allows you to expand your usage based on your requirements and budget, without any quotas or restrictions.

How does this work?
===================

1. Estimate how many credits you need

2. Add Lightning Credits to your account

3. Run Lightning Apps

4. Credits are deducted from your balance based on usage

5. Add more credits to your account based on usgae. If your credits balance is depeleted- your apps will stop running and will no longer be accessble. You will need to add credits to restart your apps. You have 30 days to add credits before storage will be deleted.
