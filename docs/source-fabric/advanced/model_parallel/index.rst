Training models with billions of parameters
###########################################

Model parallelism is a technique used in deep learning to train very large models across multiple devices, making it possible to handle models that are too big for a single device's memory.
This is important as models become increasingly complex and large.

Model parallelism comes into play when a model's parameters are too large for one GPU.
There are different types of parallelism, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.
**Data Parallelism (DDP)** divides the data across multiple devices, with each device having a complete copy of the model and processing different parts of the data.
It's easy to implement but doesn't solve memory issues for very large models.
**Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)** improves on this by spreading the model weights across GPUs, which saves memory but makes communication between devices more complex.
**Tensor Parallelism (TP)** breaks down individual layers of the model to spread them across devices, allowing for more detailed distribution but needing careful synchronization.
**Pipeline Parallelism (PP)** splits the model into stages, with each stage assigned to a different device.
This reduces memory use per device but can introduce delays and inefficiencies (pipeline bubbles).
Choosing the right type of model parallelism depends on balancing memory use, communication needs, and computational efficiency, based on the specific model and hardware setup.

Lightning Fabric supports all the parallelisms mentioned above natively through PyTorch, with the exception of pipeline parallelism (PP) which is not yet supported.
