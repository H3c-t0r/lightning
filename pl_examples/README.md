# Examples   
Our most robust examples showing all sorts of implementations
can be found in our sister library [PyTorch-Lightning-Bolts](https://pytorch-lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/convolutional.html#gpt-2).

## Basic examples
In this folder we add 3 simple examples:

* [Image Classifier]() (trains arbitrary datasets with arbitrary backbones).
* [MNIST classifier]() (defined the model inside the lightningModule).
* [Autoencoder]() (shows how the LightningModule is meant to be used as a system)

## Domain examples
This folder contains older examples. You should instead use the examples 
in [PyTorch-Lightning-Bolts](https://pytorch-lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/convolutional.html#gpt-2) 
for advanced use cases.
