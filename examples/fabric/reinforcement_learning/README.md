# Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO implementation powered by Lightning Fabric

This is an example of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) implemented in PyTorch and accelerated by [Lightning Fabric](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric/fabric.html).

The goal of Reinforcement Learning is to learn intelligent agents that are able to act in their surrounding environment maximizing the cumulative reward received by it. This can be depicted in the following figure:

PPO is one of such algorithms, which alternates between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a
“surrogate” objective function using stochastic gradient ascent.

We present two code versions: the first one is implemented in raw PyTorch, but it contains quite a bit of boilerplate code for distributed training. The second one is using Lightning Fabric to accelerate and scale the model.

Tip: You can easily inspect the difference between the two files with:

```
sdiff train_torch.py train_fabric.py
```

## Requirements

Install requirements by running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

### Raw PyTorch:

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 --standalone train_torch.py
```

You can visualize training and test logs by running

```
tensorboard --logdir torch_logs
```

### Lightning Fabric:

```
lightning run model --accelerator=cpu --strategy=ddp --devices=2 train_fabric.py
```

You can visualize training and test logs by running

```
tensorboard --logdir fabric_logs
```
