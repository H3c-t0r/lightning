<!-- 
### Common bugs:
1. Tensorboard not showing in Jupyter-notebook see [issue 79](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/79).    
2. PyTorch 1.1.0 vs 1.2.0 support [see FAQ](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning#faq)    
-->

## üêõ Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### To Reproduce

Before reporting a bug, make sure that the bug can be reproduced with a minimal example. You can simply subclass our [miminal code example] (https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report_model.py) and add your relevant changes, to see if the issue persists. 
If the test is failing, please add your test cases to the issue (as a draft PR, or simple paste the code to the isse description here).

<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->


#### Code sample
<!-- Ideally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. 
Minimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
