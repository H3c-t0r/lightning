## üêõ Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

## Please reproduce using the BoringModel


<!-- Please paste your BoringModel colab link here. -->

### To Reproduce

Use following [**BoringModel**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HvWVVTK8j2Nj52qU4Q4YCyzOm0_aLQF3?usp=sharing) and post here

<!-- If you could not reproduce using the BoringModel and still think there's a bug, please post here -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- FILL IN -->

### Environment

**Note**: `Bugs with code` are solved faster ! `Colab Notebook` should be made `public` !

* `IDE`: Please, use our python [bug_report_model.py](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report_model.py
) template.

* `Colab Notebook`: Please copy and paste the output from our [environment collection script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/master/tests/collect_env_details.py) (or fill out the checklist below manually).

You can get the script and run it with:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/master/tests/collect_env_details.py
# For security purposes, please check the contents of collect_env_details.py before running it.
python collect_env_details.py
```
