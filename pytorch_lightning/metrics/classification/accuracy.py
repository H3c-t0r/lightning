class Accuracy(Metric):
    r"""
    Computes `Accuracy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision>`_:

    .. math:: 
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N 1(y_i = \hat{y}_i)

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, and :math:`\hat{y}` is a
    tensor of predictions.

    This metric generalizes to subset accuracy for multilabel data, and similarly for
    multi-dimensional multi-class data: for the sample to be counted as correct, the the
    class has to be correctly predicted across all extra dimension for each sample in the
    ``N`` dimension. Consider using :class:`~pytorch_lightning.metrics.classification.HammingLoss`
    is this is not what you want.

    For multi-class and multi-dimensional multi-class data with probability predictions, the
    parameter ``top_k`` generalizes this metric to a Top-K accuracy metric: for each sample the
    top-K highest probability items are considered to find the correct label.

    Accepts all input types listed in :ref:`metrics:Input types`.

    Args:
        threshold:
            Threshold probability value for transforming probability predictions to binary
            (0,1) predictions, in the case of binary or multi-label inputs. Default: 0.5
        mdmc_accuracy:
            Determines how should the extra dimension be handeled in case of multi-dimensional multi-class
            inputs. Options are ``"global"`` or ``"subset"``.

            If ``"global"``, then the inputs are treated as if the sample (``N``) and the extra dimension
            were unrolled into a new sample dimension.

            If ``"subset"``, than the equivalent of subset accuracy is performed for each sample on the
            ``N`` dimension - that is, for the sample to count as correct, all labels on its extra dimension
            must be predicted correctly (the ``top_k`` option still applies here).
        top_k:
            Number of highest probability entries for each sample to convert to 1s, relevant
            only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs with probability predictions. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return None if this is set to False. default: True
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step. default: False
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: None (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When `None`, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather. default: None

    Example:

        >>> from pytorch_lightning.metrics import Accuracy
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([0, 2, 1, 3])
        >>> accuracy = Accuracy()
        >>> accuracy(preds, target)
        tensor(0.5000)

        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.9, 0], [0.3, 0.1, 0.6], [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]])
        >>> accuracy = Accuracy(top_k=2)
        >>> accuracy(preds, target)
        tensor(0.6667)
